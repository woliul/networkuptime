A simple, powerful, and **offline-first system** for tracking, logging, and proving every ISP connectivity drop. Use it as a mobile-friendly web tool or a dedicated cross-platform desktop app.

## ✨ Features

* **Dual-Access Platform**: Use it immediately as a **mobile-friendly web application** in your browser, or rely on the persistent power of the dedicated **Electron desktop app**.
* **Offline-First Resilience**: Monitoring runs entirely locally. Logging data to an embedded database ensures tracking **continues even during a total network failure.**
* **Real-time, Unbiased Checks**: Continuously validates connectivity against reliable external hosts (e.g., Google) at fast, consistent intervals. Your proof is always based on an **impartial, external source.**
* **Local, Persistent Proof**: All connection drops and restorations are logged to a local **SQLite** database. Securely persisted via **IndexedDB**, this serves as your **undeniable evidence** for any ISP dispute.
* **Mobile-Ready UI**: The fully responsive dashboard, built with **Tailwind CSS**, provides a clean and usable experience on any device, from phone to large desktop.

## ⚡ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (LTS version recommended)
* npm (comes with Node.js)

### Installation

1.  Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/woliul/uptimevault.git
    cd uptimevault
    ```

2.  Install the project dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Application

To start the application in development mode (as an Electron desktop app):

```bash
npm start
````

### Building for Production

To create a distributable installer for Windows, macOS, or Linux, the project uses **Electron Builder**. The correct script command is **`npm run build`**, which automatically runs the builder and places the final installers and archives into the dedicated `dist/` folder.

```bash
npm run build
```

> **Note**: This single command is configured to generate the appropriate installer for your current operating system (e.g., `.exe` for Windows, `.dmg` for macOS, or `.AppImage` for Linux).
